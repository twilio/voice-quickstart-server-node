Prerequisites
---

* A Twilio Account. Don't have one? [Sign up](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) for free!
* Follow the [iOS full quickstart tutorial here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/voice-sdk/ios/getting-started) or [Android full quickstart tutorial here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/voice-sdk/android/getting-started).

## Setting up the Node.js Application

Create a configuration file for your application:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with the three configuration parameters we gathered from above.

Next, we need to install our dependencies from npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Now we should be all set! Run the application using the `node` command.

```bash
node .
```

To generate Access Token, visit
[http://localhost:3000/accessToken?identity=alice](http://localhost:3000/accessToken?identity=alice).

### Up and running

This web application needs to be accessbile on the public internet in order to receive webhook requests from Twilio. [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a great options for getting this done quickly.

Once you have the application running locally, in a separate terminal window, make your server available to the public internet with the following:

    ngrok http 3000

You should see a dynamically generated public Ngrok URL in the command window. Ngrok will now tunnel all HTTP traffic directed at this URL to your local machine at port 3000.

### Deploy to the cloud using [Heroku](https://heroku.com)

Don't want to run the application server locally? You can also deploy it to the cloud using Heroku. Note: For this option, you'll want to gather your Twilio Account SID, API Key, API Key Secret, Push Credential SID and TwiML App SID before beginning the installation. (Don't know what these are? Read through the [Programmable Voice iOS SDK Quickstart](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/voice-sdk/ios/getting-started) or [Programmable Voice Android SDK Quickstart](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/voice-sdk/android/getting-started) for all the information.

If you don't already have one, visit Heroku and create a free account. Once that's done, click the button below to automatically set up this app, and enter the Twilio account information you gathered above when you're prompted.

Test the app
---

Test your app by opening the `/accessToken` endpoint in your browser (use the publicly accessible domain on Heroku or Ngrok, whichever you chose above). You should see a long string. This is an Access Token. You can examine its contents by pasting it into a JWT tool like [jwt.io](http://jwt.io).
